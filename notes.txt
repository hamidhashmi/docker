1. # Docker along with client and daemon is called as the docker engine

2. #Docker can be used to run both stateful and stateless apps

stateful serv/app remembers what it has done before - databases, key-value stores
stateless app does not have memory - web servers

3. containers are based off an image.

image = stopped container
container = running image

no images implies no container

4. containers are like VMs i.e start stop restart, not until explicitly destroyed or deleted you lose them.

remove using rm then only delete it

5. containers are single process constructs. Here it is running bash and only bash.

command - docker run -it --name temp ubuntu:latest /bin/bash

[root@ip-10-1-254-230 ~]# docker run -it --name temp ubuntu:latest /bin/bash
root@3a42433b1f97:/#


Notice, the prompt has changed. Means we have logged in to the container ubuntu.

The other processes seen (ps and top) are temporary processes that bash created (forked) when we ran those respective commands.

If you type exit, bash exits, causing the container to exit as bash is the only running process.
Thus, another way to exit a container without killing it is by typing ctrl+p+q
Then docker ps - it is still running in the background.

[root@ip-10-1-254-230 ~]# docker ps
